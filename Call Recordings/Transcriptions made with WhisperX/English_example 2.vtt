Hello.

00:17.808 --> 00:22.554
Hello.

00:22.574 --> 00:24.817
Hi, this is Amanda.

00:26.399 --> 00:27.401
Sorry.

00:27.421 --> 00:29.944
This is a casting calling from college.

00:30.064 --> 00:34.991
I was just calling to go with some options you have on your account before it expires.

00:35.051 --> 00:37.534
Do you have a few minutes to speak today to hear the promo?

00:39.537 --> 00:39.657
Sorry?

00:40.666 --> 00:43.310
Do you have a few minutes to speak today to hear the promos?

00:45.754 --> 00:45.855
Yeah.

00:45.875 --> 00:52.025
Okay, so currently right now we have some great deals if you're looking to get a new device you wanted to upgrade.

00:52.085 --> 00:59.277
The S25 Samsung is on sale as well as the Flip 6 Samsung.

01:00.599 --> 01:05.307
Our iPhone 16 and 15 is on sale as well, just base model.

01:05.860 --> 01:10.767
You also qualify for streaming services, which include Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime.

01:11.208 --> 01:15.454
You can save up to 21% off when you bundle it to your mobility.

01:16.135 --> 01:21.863
So you get all three for the price of, like, maybe one if you're paying for streaming services already.

01:21.923 --> 01:28.593
Plus you get a fourth one, complimentary, which is TELUS Films, which is, like, local shows that you can watch.

01:30.175 --> 01:30.656
Right.

01:34.181 --> 01:34.281
Okay.

01:37.130 --> 01:42.779
Were you thinking of maybe upgrading your phone, adding a line, or interested in streaming services?

01:42.799 --> 01:44.121
Yeah, I was thinking of upgrading my phone.

01:45.443 --> 01:45.884
Pardon me?

01:47.026 --> 01:48.989
Yeah, I was thinking of upgrading my phone.

01:49.790 --> 01:50.471
Upgrading your phone.

01:50.491 --> 01:51.372
What phone do you have right now?

01:52.755 --> 01:55.539
I am currently having iPhone 11 Pro.

01:57.182 --> 01:57.742
Which iPhone?

01:58.684 --> 01:59.766
11 Pro.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.028
11 Pro.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.812
Were you looking for a Pro series?

02:04.805 --> 02:07.149
Is the base model, like, good for you?

02:08.911 --> 02:10.514
Yeah, basic model will work for me as well.

02:10.534 --> 02:10.714
Okay.

02:11.095 --> 02:16.864
Okay, let me tell you what's on sale between the newest models.

02:16.884 --> 02:25.037
So iPhone 16 right now is $35.29, and iPhone 16 is $34.21.

02:25.397 --> 02:29.964
So obviously the newer one is cheaper by around $2 to $1.

02:30.084 --> 02:31.707
Yeah.

02:31.754 --> 02:39.410
So in order to get a phone, though, you would have to change your plan, what I could do for you, minimum plan I can offer.

02:43.799 --> 02:49.712
Yeah, I will tell you the complete price.

02:49.852 --> 02:51.636
Give me one second.

03:01.049 --> 03:04.034
So plan and phone included, 107.66.

03:04.134 --> 03:07.580
So the plan is $65.

03:07.640 --> 03:11.667
You get 100 GB, and the phone is $34.21.

03:11.887 --> 03:15.333
With pass, 107.66.

03:15.654 --> 03:20.642
That's way too much for me.

03:20.662 --> 03:21.023
Okay.

03:21.583 --> 03:22.225
No problem.

03:22.846 --> 03:26.011
Well, we will have back-to-school deals in July or August.

03:26.091 --> 03:27.293
So if you are...

03:27.627 --> 03:33.625
thinking about maybe doing it then, you can give me a call back to check with prices and then we can go through there, okay?

03:34.629 --> 03:35.331
Yeah, I will, okay.

03:35.612 --> 03:37.477
Okay, have a good day, bye.

03:37.497 --> 03:37.738
Thanks, bye.
