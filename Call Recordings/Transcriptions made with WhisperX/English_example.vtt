00:03.828 --> 00:04.809
Hey, Manpreet.

00:05.450 --> 00:06.853
Hi, how are you, Mr. Paul?

00:09.396 --> 00:10.198
Are you available now?

00:11.359 --> 00:12.922
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12.942 --> 00:13.583
Thanks for calling back.

00:14.384 --> 00:18.270
Yeah, just give me a second to kind of open up your account again.

00:18.310 --> 00:24.560
So, yeah, it looks like self-install is available at your address, right?

00:26.162 --> 00:26.903
What is available?

00:27.744 --> 00:28.806
Self-install.

00:29.005 --> 00:33.231
So I will be able to give you more bill credits that way instead of calling a technician.

00:34.052 --> 00:37.858
If I roll out a technician, they'll be charging you $200, right?

00:38.679 --> 00:45.609
So I prefer to kind of give you more bill credits to work with to use towards your first bill, right?

00:46.711 --> 00:48.654
Okay.

00:48.694 --> 00:56.085
Did you find out like when you're going to be canceling the services with Rogers or wherever you're using it now?

00:56.105 --> 00:58.388
I just put a request for next Tuesday.

00:58.874 --> 01:24.898
next tuesday okay okay next tuesday sweet sweet um so remember um what we were talking about last time uh for the one gigabyte of internet it was 68 dollars uh would you be uh wanting to go forward with that the same same price and same deal right okay yeah i i can promise you it's the best one we have we have right now so it's a cheap one i'd probably

01:25.030 --> 01:47.460
i only have one concern can i have the billing under the business name or it needs to be under the person's name um oh like a business name um for this since it's residential it does have to be under uh like your your your uh yeah exactly your name okay okay

02:01.143 --> 02:06.290
But yeah, I really appreciate getting the internet from me.

02:06.310 --> 02:10.116
It really helped me in my workplace.

02:10.416 --> 02:15.243
Let's see.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.765
It's a little slow today.

02:16.785 --> 02:20.951
I work with the bank, so I know what target means.

02:22.093 --> 02:22.293
Oh, yeah.

02:22.674 --> 02:23.935
Thank you.

02:25.538 --> 02:27.781
Where do you work, may I ask?

02:27.801 --> 02:29.323
I work in a credit union.

02:29.343 --> 02:30.745
It's a service credit union.

02:31.214 --> 02:55.568
oh okay okay interesting so what self install means um it means we're going to be shipping out the modem to your like the wi-fi hub to your house and in the box it's gonna have all the instructions how to install everything um it's going to be pretty straightforward

02:55.885 --> 03:07.422
And again, even if you do need help, you can always call customer service or tech supports and they will definitely guide you down the line if you do need help downloading it.

03:07.502 --> 03:09.145
I mean, sorry, installing it.

03:09.926 --> 03:16.696
And also there are videos online on the PELS website on how to install the Wi-Fi hub and everything, right?

03:16.716 --> 03:17.898
So it should be very straightforward.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.864
Okay.

03:21.884 --> 03:23.226
Getting to the page two.

03:23.695 --> 03:28.323
I'm going to activate the services.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.488
Generally, when do you want to be using tele-internet?

03:33.030 --> 03:38.459
So once you mail me, how long will it take for me to receive it?

03:39.040 --> 03:42.606
So we do say that it takes three to five business days.

03:44.148 --> 03:47.053
I think we are aware that Canada Post is...

03:47.455 --> 03:49.297
I think they are on a strike right now.

03:49.558 --> 03:52.561
So we will use other different methods to ship it out to you, right?

03:53.082 --> 03:55.145
Either through like FedEx or Purolator, right?

03:55.986 --> 04:00.972
If you ship today, maybe by the beginning of next week, I will receive it?

04:02.454 --> 04:05.077
Most likely, or maybe the end of this week, right?

04:05.157 --> 04:08.241
Maybe a Friday, because it is like three business days or so.

04:09.863 --> 04:15.690
But yeah, so my experience of customers getting the Wi-Fi modems,

04:15.940 --> 04:20.704
is when I signed them up on a Sunday, they gave me feedback that they got it on a Tuesday.

04:21.165 --> 04:22.186
So it is fairly quick.

04:23.367 --> 04:23.907
Okay.

04:23.927 --> 04:26.629
So maybe I will be receiving it by 23rd.

04:27.070 --> 04:30.953
Maybe let's activate on the 26th then.

04:30.973 --> 04:31.294
26th?

04:31.474 --> 04:32.114
Okay.

04:32.134 --> 04:39.721
So since the self-install, right, it only shifts out starting from the actual install date.

04:40.282 --> 04:41.623
I mean, like an activation date.

04:42.343 --> 04:45.306
So I do have to activate it from today.

04:46.012 --> 04:49.196
to actually ship out from today or tomorrow.

04:49.216 --> 04:49.717
Is that okay?

04:50.538 --> 04:52.441
Yeah, just ship it by today, that's fine.

04:52.461 --> 04:53.422
Okay, yeah, sure.

04:53.863 --> 04:57.868
Awesome.

04:57.888 --> 05:04.738
Yeah, I just said I don't want you to be left without internet since you did set up a cancellation date next week, right?

05:05.218 --> 05:10.686
So, yeah, I just had to kind of ship it out today as soon as possible.

05:21.770 --> 05:28.599
And again, since I really appreciate you coming back to me, I did throw on $150 in credits.

05:28.619 --> 05:32.704
So the installation and activation charge for the internet is $70.

05:33.264 --> 05:38.952
But that $150 will cover that for sure, and you'll be left with $80 to use towards your first bills.

05:39.813 --> 05:44.639
And if you have a little bit less, it'll just automatically apply to the second one.

05:44.659 --> 05:45.600
Okay?

05:45.620 --> 05:46.942
Okay, thank you.

05:46.962 --> 05:48.784
No problem.

05:50.106 --> 05:51.287
Okay, so...

05:51.554 --> 06:01.024
The internet itself is going to be $73, and once you set up automatic payments on the MyTelus app, it'll give you automatic discounts of $5.

06:01.425 --> 06:03.026
So that'll bring it down to $68.

06:03.046 --> 06:07.531
Did you have any questions on how to download anything?

06:08.072 --> 06:09.974
Since we're on the phone, I can definitely guide you down.

06:10.975 --> 06:11.636
Oh, no, I'm okay.

06:12.377 --> 06:12.977
Okay, perfect.

06:13.278 --> 06:17.342
Yeah, you just have to download the MyTelus app and then log in.

06:18.233 --> 06:21.036
The ID will be the email that you gave me last time.

06:21.576 --> 06:23.598
It should be the Gmail one, I think.

06:24.359 --> 06:24.619
Okay.

06:24.959 --> 06:28.562
The ManpreCoreBrar at 399 at gmail.com, right?

06:29.203 --> 06:29.503
Yeah.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.684
Perfect, perfect.

06:31.485 --> 06:32.346
All right.

06:34.808 --> 06:35.128
Okay.

06:35.328 --> 06:41.534
I just want to let you know, again, this is a recorded call since we are doing it over the phone.

06:41.554 --> 06:45.558
Since we're not signing anything, I do have to have it recorded, our contract, right?

06:46.639 --> 06:48.240
So I'm just going to go over it with you again.

06:48.473 --> 06:50.935
We are getting the internet.

06:51.215 --> 06:58.802
The service address will be Apartment Suites 4306, 240 Skyview Ranch Road Northeast.

06:58.882 --> 07:04.467
Internet package that I'm getting you is the Gigabyte of Speed Pure Fiber Internet.

07:04.547 --> 07:09.371
It's originally priced at $135, but all the discounts that I've applied, it's brought it down to $73.

07:09.911 --> 07:13.995
And once you add the automatic payments, it'll be negative $5, so you get the price of $68.

07:14.115 --> 07:17.518
I have given you $150 in bill credits.

07:17.819 --> 07:26.815
So you're left with, after all the activation charges taken off of that, you're left with $80 to use towards your first or several bills.

07:27.816 --> 07:33.386
And the activation date will be today so that the Wi-Fi hub will ship out right away.

07:33.406 --> 07:40.979
I am expecting it to be arriving around Friday or around Monday if latest.

07:41.220 --> 07:42.362
Okay?

07:42.382 --> 07:42.662
Okay.

07:43.250 --> 07:48.356
Alrighty, let me just go ahead and process that order.

07:48.416 --> 07:54.703
Other than that, did you have any other questions for me?

07:54.804 --> 07:59.829
Did you need any help signing off for other additional services?

08:00.690 --> 08:04.455
No, no, I'm okay.

08:06.918 --> 08:07.198
Awesome, okay.

08:08.731 --> 08:13.538
I am also going to be sending a copy of this agreement to your email, so you have it on hand.

08:14.539 --> 08:15.721
I just sent it.

08:15.821 --> 08:17.303
Do you want to double check if you got it?

08:18.805 --> 08:19.386
Yes, I did.

08:20.047 --> 08:20.507
Perfect.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.910
Yeah, that pretty much outlines everything.

08:22.971 --> 08:34.126
Your account number, if you have to add it on the MyTelis, the confirmation number, the order number, and pretty much everything that I outlined just now over the phone should be on there.

08:34.827 --> 08:36.409
Okay, sounds good.

08:37.587 --> 08:38.248
Alrighty.

08:38.408 --> 08:43.596
Yeah, so everything's processed pretty much, and I'm going to go ahead and push it through.

08:43.636 --> 08:46.220
Did you have any other questions for me?

08:47.141 --> 08:47.842
No, I'm okay.

08:47.862 --> 08:48.964
Thank you so much for that.

08:48.984 --> 08:49.084
Okay.

08:49.705 --> 08:52.149
Again, Memphrey, thank you so much for calling back.

08:52.589 --> 08:53.491
I really appreciate it.

08:53.571 --> 09:03.105
If you do need help with other services or any services that you bought from me today, please do feel free to give me a call or come by the store, and I'll definitely help you out, okay?

09:03.676 --> 09:04.802
For sure, no problem.

09:04.822 --> 09:05.566
Thank you so much.

09:05.808 --> 09:06.411
All righty.

09:06.552 --> 09:06.894
Thank you.

09:06.914 --> 09:07.477
Have a nice day.

09:07.497 --> 09:08.120
Bye-bye.

09:08.140 --> 09:08.623
Bye-bye.
