3828	4809	Hey, Manpreet.
5450	6853	Hi, how are you, Mr. Paul?
9396	10198	Are you available now?
11359	12922	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
12942	13583	Thanks for calling back.
14384	18270	Yeah, just give me a second to kind of open up your account again.
18310	24560	So, yeah, it looks like self-install is available at your address, right?
26162	26903	What is available?
27744	28806	Self-install.
29005	33231	So I will be able to give you more bill credits that way instead of calling a technician.
34052	37858	If I roll out a technician, they'll be charging you $200, right?
38679	45609	So I prefer to kind of give you more bill credits to work with to use towards your first bill, right?
46711	48654	Okay.
48694	56085	Did you find out like when you're going to be canceling the services with Rogers or wherever you're using it now?
56105	58388	I just put a request for next Tuesday.
58874	84898	next tuesday okay okay next tuesday sweet sweet um so remember um what we were talking about last time uh for the one gigabyte of internet it was 68 dollars uh would you be uh wanting to go forward with that the same same price and same deal right okay yeah i i can promise you it's the best one we have we have right now so it's a cheap one i'd probably
85030	107460	i only have one concern can i have the billing under the business name or it needs to be under the person's name um oh like a business name um for this since it's residential it does have to be under uh like your your your uh yeah exactly your name okay okay
121143	126290	But yeah, I really appreciate getting the internet from me.
126310	130116	It really helped me in my workplace.
130416	135243	Let's see.
135303	136765	It's a little slow today.
136785	140951	I work with the bank, so I know what target means.
142093	142293	Oh, yeah.
142674	143935	Thank you.
145538	147781	Where do you work, may I ask?
147801	149323	I work in a credit union.
149343	150745	It's a service credit union.
151214	175568	oh okay okay interesting so what self install means um it means we're going to be shipping out the modem to your like the wi-fi hub to your house and in the box it's gonna have all the instructions how to install everything um it's going to be pretty straightforward
175885	187422	And again, even if you do need help, you can always call customer service or tech supports and they will definitely guide you down the line if you do need help downloading it.
187502	189145	I mean, sorry, installing it.
189926	196696	And also there are videos online on the PELS website on how to install the Wi-Fi hub and everything, right?
196716	197898	So it should be very straightforward.
198900	201864	Okay.
201884	203226	Getting to the page two.
203695	208323	I'm going to activate the services.
208583	211488	Generally, when do you want to be using tele-internet?
213030	218459	So once you mail me, how long will it take for me to receive it?
219040	222606	So we do say that it takes three to five business days.
224148	227053	I think we are aware that Canada Post is...
227455	229297	I think they are on a strike right now.
229558	232561	So we will use other different methods to ship it out to you, right?
233082	235145	Either through like FedEx or Purolator, right?
235986	240972	If you ship today, maybe by the beginning of next week, I will receive it?
242454	245077	Most likely, or maybe the end of this week, right?
245157	248241	Maybe a Friday, because it is like three business days or so.
249863	255690	But yeah, so my experience of customers getting the Wi-Fi modems,
255940	260704	is when I signed them up on a Sunday, they gave me feedback that they got it on a Tuesday.
261165	262186	So it is fairly quick.
263367	263907	Okay.
263927	266629	So maybe I will be receiving it by 23rd.
267070	270953	Maybe let's activate on the 26th then.
270973	271294	26th?
271474	272114	Okay.
272134	279721	So since the self-install, right, it only shifts out starting from the actual install date.
280282	281623	I mean, like an activation date.
282343	285306	So I do have to activate it from today.
286012	289196	to actually ship out from today or tomorrow.
289216	289717	Is that okay?
290538	292441	Yeah, just ship it by today, that's fine.
292461	293422	Okay, yeah, sure.
293863	297868	Awesome.
297888	304738	Yeah, I just said I don't want you to be left without internet since you did set up a cancellation date next week, right?
305218	310686	So, yeah, I just had to kind of ship it out today as soon as possible.
321770	328599	And again, since I really appreciate you coming back to me, I did throw on $150 in credits.
328619	332704	So the installation and activation charge for the internet is $70.
333264	338952	But that $150 will cover that for sure, and you'll be left with $80 to use towards your first bills.
339813	344639	And if you have a little bit less, it'll just automatically apply to the second one.
344659	345600	Okay?
345620	346942	Okay, thank you.
346962	348784	No problem.
350106	351287	Okay, so...
351554	361024	The internet itself is going to be $73, and once you set up automatic payments on the MyTelus app, it'll give you automatic discounts of $5.
361425	363026	So that'll bring it down to $68.
363046	367531	Did you have any questions on how to download anything?
368072	369974	Since we're on the phone, I can definitely guide you down.
370975	371636	Oh, no, I'm okay.
372377	372977	Okay, perfect.
373278	377342	Yeah, you just have to download the MyTelus app and then log in.
378233	381036	The ID will be the email that you gave me last time.
381576	383598	It should be the Gmail one, I think.
384359	384619	Okay.
384959	388562	The ManpreCoreBrar at 399 at gmail.com, right?
389203	389503	Yeah.
389723	390684	Perfect, perfect.
391485	392346	All right.
394808	395128	Okay.
395328	401534	I just want to let you know, again, this is a recorded call since we are doing it over the phone.
401554	405558	Since we're not signing anything, I do have to have it recorded, our contract, right?
406639	408240	So I'm just going to go over it with you again.
408473	410935	We are getting the internet.
411215	418802	The service address will be Apartment Suites 4306, 240 Skyview Ranch Road Northeast.
418882	424467	Internet package that I'm getting you is the Gigabyte of Speed Pure Fiber Internet.
424547	429371	It's originally priced at $135, but all the discounts that I've applied, it's brought it down to $73.
429911	433995	And once you add the automatic payments, it'll be negative $5, so you get the price of $68.
434115	437518	I have given you $150 in bill credits.
437819	446815	So you're left with, after all the activation charges taken off of that, you're left with $80 to use towards your first or several bills.
447816	453386	And the activation date will be today so that the Wi-Fi hub will ship out right away.
453406	460979	I am expecting it to be arriving around Friday or around Monday if latest.
461220	462362	Okay?
462382	462662	Okay.
463250	468356	Alrighty, let me just go ahead and process that order.
468416	474703	Other than that, did you have any other questions for me?
474804	479829	Did you need any help signing off for other additional services?
480690	484455	No, no, I'm okay.
486918	487198	Awesome, okay.
488731	493538	I am also going to be sending a copy of this agreement to your email, so you have it on hand.
494539	495721	I just sent it.
495821	497303	Do you want to double check if you got it?
498805	499386	Yes, I did.
500047	500507	Perfect.
500567	502910	Yeah, that pretty much outlines everything.
502971	514126	Your account number, if you have to add it on the MyTelis, the confirmation number, the order number, and pretty much everything that I outlined just now over the phone should be on there.
514827	516409	Okay, sounds good.
517587	518248	Alrighty.
518408	523596	Yeah, so everything's processed pretty much, and I'm going to go ahead and push it through.
523636	526220	Did you have any other questions for me?
527141	527842	No, I'm okay.
527862	528964	Thank you so much for that.
528984	529084	Okay.
529705	532149	Again, Memphrey, thank you so much for calling back.
532589	533491	I really appreciate it.
533571	543105	If you do need help with other services or any services that you bought from me today, please do feel free to give me a call or come by the store, and I'll definitely help you out, okay?
543676	544802	For sure, no problem.
544822	545566	Thank you so much.
545808	546411	All righty.
546552	546894	Thank you.
546914	547477	Have a nice day.
547497	548120	Bye-bye.
548140	548623	Bye-bye.
