00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,843
Hello.

2
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:22,554
Hello.

3
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:24,817
Hi, this is Amanda.

4
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,401
Sorry.

5
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,944
This is a casting calling from college.

6
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:34,991
I was just calling to go with some options you have on your account before it expires.

7
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:37,534
Do you have a few minutes to speak today to hear the promo?

8
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:39,657
Sorry?

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,310
Do you have a few minutes to speak today to hear the promos?

10
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:45,855
Yeah.

11
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:52,025
Okay, so currently right now we have some great deals if you're looking to get a new device you wanted to upgrade.

12
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:59,277
The S25 Samsung is on sale as well as the Flip 6 Samsung.

13
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:05,307
Our iPhone 16 and 15 is on sale as well, just base model.

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,767
You also qualify for streaming services, which include Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime.

15
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:15,454
You can save up to 21% off when you bundle it to your mobility.

16
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:21,863
So you get all three for the price of, like, maybe one if you're paying for streaming services already.

17
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:28,593
Plus you get a fourth one, complimentary, which is TELUS Films, which is, like, local shows that you can watch.

18
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:30,656
Right.

19
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:34,281
Okay.

20
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,779
Were you thinking of maybe upgrading your phone, adding a line, or interested in streaming services?

21
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,121
Yeah, I was thinking of upgrading my phone.

22
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:45,884
Pardon me?

23
00:01:47,026 --> 00:01:48,989
Yeah, I was thinking of upgrading my phone.

24
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,471
Upgrading your phone.

25
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:51,372
What phone do you have right now?

26
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:55,539
I am currently having iPhone 11 Pro.

27
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:57,742
Which iPhone?

28
00:01:58,684 --> 00:01:59,766
11 Pro.

29
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,028
11 Pro.

30
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,812
Were you looking for a Pro series?

31
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:07,149
Is the base model, like, good for you?

32
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:10,514
Yeah, basic model will work for me as well.

33
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:10,714
Okay.

34
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:16,864
Okay, let me tell you what's on sale between the newest models.

35
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:25,037
So iPhone 16 right now is $35.29, and iPhone 16 is $34.21.

36
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:29,964
So obviously the newer one is cheaper by around $2 to $1.

37
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,707
Yeah.

38
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:39,410
So in order to get a phone, though, you would have to change your plan, what I could do for you, minimum plan I can offer.

39
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:49,712
Yeah, I will tell you the complete price.

40
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:51,636
Give me one second.

41
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,034
So plan and phone included, 107.66.

42
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:07,580
So the plan is $65.

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,667
You get 100 GB, and the phone is $34.21.

44
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:15,333
With pass, 107.66.

45
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:20,642
That's way too much for me.

46
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:21,023
Okay.

47
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,225
No problem.

48
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:26,011
Well, we will have back-to-school deals in July or August.

49
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:27,293
So if you are...

50
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:33,625
thinking about maybe doing it then, you can give me a call back to check with prices and then we can go through there, okay?

51
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:35,331
Yeah, I will, okay.

52
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:37,477
Okay, have a good day, bye.

53
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:37,738
Thanks, bye.
